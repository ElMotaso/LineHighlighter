Write a program in python that transforms the cursor into a transparent but highlighting bar so users can easier stay in a line while reading. use python for that. also provide a small window where users can set the width, height, transparency and colour. the program should run on macos, linux and windows. do it in whatever means you deem most practical.

current issues (assume all other issues known to you are solved if you dont find them here):
- i have to click on the bar once for the shortcut to work
- i still cant scroll the window behind the bar or click
