if on windows: dist/LineHighlighter.exe is the standalone program
if on other platform:
- install the dependencies of build_app.py and run:
  python build_app.py

this will create the standalone for your platform hopefully (not tested)
if you are a good boy you create a pull request for this repo so that i dont have to build the app on all platforms

When the highlighter is active, changing a value in the settings dialog now updates the bar immediately.
